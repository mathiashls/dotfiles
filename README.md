# Dotfiles

Mathias Hillesheim's dotfiles.

I decided to use a centralized folder system to make it easy to setup all my dotfiles.

I have one folder containing all the configuration for each PC or Notebook I use (home, college, work). As long as I keep my `$(hostname)` matching the correct folder that keeps the configs, all I need to do is run `./setup` and *magic will happen*.

| Hostname/config | Machine       |
|-----------------|---------------|
| moria           | Desktop       |
| tirith          | Macbook       |
